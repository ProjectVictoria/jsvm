JSVM_4_3 -> JSVM_4_4
====================

Weighted prediction (encoder algorithm)

Change log:
Date: March 17, 2006
Author: Purvin Pandit (Thomson)
Contribution: JVT-P064

Changes:

1) Added weighted prediction algorithm for encoder (scale and offset)
2) Weights for the Enhancement layer are always inherited if the corresponding base layer picture exists otherwise they are calculated
3) Only scales are used in wp. Offsets are never used although code has been provided.



JSVM_4_2 -> JSVM_4_3
====================

Smoothed reference prediction

date: march 11, 2006
author: Woo-Jin Han (Samsung Electronics)
contribution: JVT-R091

changes:

1) According to JVT-R091, an additional prediction using smoothing function is added for single-loop decoding case. Smoothing function is applied to the sum of MC prediction and base-layer residual signal.

2) New mode is signalled by additional syntax item only when the base_mode_flag and residual_prediction_flag are set.

3) In motion estimation process, new functions to compute R-D cost of smoothed reference prediction are added for both 4x4 and 8x8 transform cases.

4) New short-term test "SmoothedRef" is added.

major S/W changes:

 [ CommonLib changes ]

 IntYuvPicBuffer: 3 new smoothing functions -> smoothMbInside(), smoothMbLeft() and smoothMbTop()
 MbDataStruct: new MB variable -> m_bSmoothedRefFlag

 [ Encoder-side changes ]

 GOPEncoder: 
     xFixMCPrediction() (called in xCompositionStage)
       -> fix normal MC prediction with considerations of smoothed reference
     xFixOrgResidual() (called in xEncodeHighPassPictures)
       -> fix original residual with considerations of smoothed reference (necessary for FGS)
 MbCoder: code segment to call smoothedRefFlag() when base_mode_flag && residual_prediction_flag = 1
 MbEncoder:
     new process for smoothed residual prediction (in encodeResidual)
     new process for computing R-D cost of smoothed residual prediction (in estimatePrediction)
     (xEstimateMbSR, xSetRdCostInterMbSR, xSetRdCost8x8InterMbSR, and xCheckInterMbMode8x8SR)
 CabacWriter & UvlcWriter: smoothedRefFlag() -> write smoothed_ref_flag syntax item

 [ Decoder-side changes ]

 CabacReader & UvlcReader: smoothedRefFlag() -> read smoothed_ref_flag syntax item
 MbDecoder: code segment in xDecodeMbInter() to generate smoothed reference prediction
 MbParser: code segment to call smoothedRefFlag() when base_mode_flag && residual_prediction_flag = 1

2-loop AR-FGS integration

date: march 6, 2006
author: Xianglin Wang (Nokia)
contribution: JVT-R077

changes:

1) Modified AR-FGS buffer usage at decoder. Now it uses pictures from DPB for AR-FGS reference. So it can handle  reference picture reordering, etc. Meanwhile, I also cleaned up some necessary buffers. 

2) According to JVT-R077, added decoder-oriented two loop FGS coding structure and a FGS entropy coder with a new coding order. 

3) A couple of bug fixes from Shijun after his integration. 

4) Bug fix recommendation from Heiko regarding an assertation failure in function xMarkShortTermUnused()

ESS TOOLS INTEGRATION

date: february 18, 2006
authors: J.Vieron (Thomson) and S.Sun (Sharp)
contributions: JVT-Q038, JVT-Q015, JVT-R018, JVT-R006

changes:
 
 downconvert.inl:
 ----------------
 Cleaning of the initialisation. (very minor)

 downconvert.h, downconvertTmm.inl:
 ---------------------------------
 Cleaning. 
 -Removal of methods xInitFilterTmmResidual(), xDestroyFilterTmmResidual(),xGenericUpsample(),xUpsamplingFrame(),xUpsamplingBlock(), 
   xComputeLastSamplePosition(), xUpsamplingDataResidual ().
 -Removal of members m_pitmpDes4,m_pitmpDes8,m_pitmpDes16; 
                                   
 -Implementation of the upsampling 16 taps filter (adopted as normative cf. JVT-Q038)
 -Dyadic becomes a special case of ESS. For luma in the dyadic case, the previous method filters at phase 0 position while the ESS mode interpolates 
 at phase 1/2 [JVT-R018]
 -Implementation of ESS downsampling filters (seven new sets of filters) based on the sine-windowed sinc function. (This is a 12 tap filters)[JVT-R006]

 MbData.h , MbData.cpp:
 ----------------------
 Extension of the ESS mechanisms to support scaling ratios greater than 2 (cf. [JVT-Q015]) 
 (->Introduction of a new method "xInitInfoBaseDim")
 Various bug fixes.  
 
 main.cpp (DownConvert):
 ----------------------
 Replacement of "malloc" by "new".
  
 main.cpp (PSNR):
 ---------------
 Replacement of "malloc" by "new".
 
 EncoderCodingParameter.h:
 -------------------------
 Add of 4 new options in encoder config file:
 "ESSChromaPhaseX","ESSChromaPhaseY", "ESSBaseChromaPhaseX","ESSBaseChromaPhaseY"
 Changes in inititialisation of ResizeParameters.
  
 GOPDecoder.h,  GOPDecoder.cpp:
 -----------------------------
  Removal of method "fillPredictionLists_ESS". It has been replaced by a new piece of code in GOPDecoder.cpp (in method "xInitBaseLayer").
  The goal of "fillPredictionLists_ESS" and, now, of the new code, is to associate reference list index and POC on the entire GOP. It is mandatory 
  to support the Picture Level ESS.
 
 GOPEncoder.cpp:
 ----------------
 Changes related to chroma phase shift
 
 MbDecoder, MotionEstimation.cpp, MotionEstimationQuarterPer.cpp:
 ----------------------------------------------------
 Bug fixes to allow a real 1/4 pel refinement in case of ESS motion upsampling. 
  
 ResizeParameters.h,ResizeParameters.cpp:
 ----------------------------------------
 "m_acCurrentGop" replaces "m_pcCurrentGop".
 Initialisation of parameters related to chroma phases (m_iChromaPhaseX, m_iBaseChromaPhaseX...) [JVT-Q038,JVT-R018]
 
 SequenceParameterSet.cpp:
 ------------------------
 Dyadic case becomes a special ESS case ([JVT-R018]).
 Initialisation of parameter "m_uiBaseChromaPhaseXPlus1"(to support a correct chroma phase shift). [JVT-R018]
 
 
 SliceHeaderBase.cpp:
 --------------------
 Initialisation of parameter "m_uiBaseChromaPhaseXPlus1"(to support a correct chroma phase shift). [JVT-R018]
